Broadcasting---Low-Exponent-RSA-Attack
======================================

In this project we are dealing with decrypting a cipher which was encrypted using RSA. We are employing the Chinese remainder theorem to decrypt the ciphertext.  To study RSA algorithm in detail.  To understand the Chinese remainder theorem.  To be able to successfully decrypt the ciphertext using the Chinese remainder theorem.  To be able to use the public exponents and moduli from the given certificates of the three business partners.  Suggest methods that can be implemented in order to avoid attacks.
